# Python Tuples

Tuples are like lists, but are immutable. They can't be modified once defined. However, finding values in a tuple is faster than in a list.

## Setup

```
mkdir -p ~/workspace/python/exercises/tuples && cd $_
touch zoo.py
subl .
```

## Instructions

1. Create a tuple named `zoo` that contains your favorite animals.
1. Find one of your animals using the `.index(value)` method on the tuple.
1. Determine if an animal is in your tuple by using `for value in tuple`.
1. Create a variable for each of the animals in your tuple with this cool feature of Python.

    ```
    # example
    (lizard, fox, mammoth) = zoo
    print(lizard)
    ```

1. Convert your tuple into a list.
1. Use `extend()` to add three more animals to your zoo.
1. Convert the list back into a tuple.
